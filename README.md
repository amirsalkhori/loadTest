This is a Go programming language code that simulates a load test on a web service by sending a large number of requests to a specific URL using the HTTP POST method.

The main() function starts by setting up the load test parameters, including the number of requests to be sent, a timeout for each request, and a wait group to ensure that all goroutines (concurrent threads of execution) have finished.

The code then creates an HTTP client with the specified timeout and starts a loop to send the specified number of requests. For each request, a new goroutine is started that sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL and waits for the response. The payload for each request is hardcoded in the code as a string.

The HTTP request headers for each request are also hardcoded in the code, including cache control, content type, postman token, accept header, and host header.

When a response is received, the code reads the response body and prints it to the console. The goroutine then finishes and signals the wait group that it has completed.

Finally, the code waits for all goroutines to finish and calculates the duration of the load test and the requests per second. The results are printed to the console.

Note that the actual URL and payload for the HTTP POST request are not provided in the code and should be replaced with the appropriate values for the web service being tested.
